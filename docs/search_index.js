The constraint coefficients associated with a particular decision variable form a column of the constraint matrix. Hence constraints are sometimes referred to as rows, and decision variables as columns. Constraint matrix coefficients may be zero. Indeed, for large practical problems it is typical for most of the coefficients to be zero. When this property can be exploited to computational advantage, the matrix is said to be sparse. When the constraint matrix is not sparse, the solution of large problems is normally intractable computationally.","category":"page"},{"location":"terminology.html#Optimization-outcomes","page":"Terminology","title":"Optimization outcomes","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"terminology.html","page":"Terminology","title":"Terminology","text":"It is possible to define a set of constraints and bounds that cannot be satisfied, in which case the problem is said to be infeasible. Conversely, it is possible that the value of the objective function can be improved without bound whilst satisfying the constraints and bounds, in which case the problem is said to be unbounded. If a problem is neither infeasible, nor unbounded, it has an optimal solution. The optimal objective function value for a linear optimization problem may be achieved at more than point, in which case the optimal solution is said to be non-unique.","category":"page"},{"location":"terminology.html#Basic-solution-of-LP-problems","page":"Terminology","title":"Basic solution of LP problems","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"terminology.html","page":"Terminology","title":"Terminology","text":"An LP problem that is neither infeasible, nor unbounded, has an optimal solution at a vertex.

For continuous problems, each variable and constraint has an associated dual variable. The values of the dual variables constitute the dual solution, and it is for this reason that the term primal solution is used to distinguish the optimal values of the decision variables. At the optimal solution of a continuous problem, some of the decision variables and values of constraint functions will be equal to their lower or upper bounds. Such a bound is said to be active. If a variable or constraint is at a bound, its corresponding dual solution value will generally be non-zero: when at a lower bound the dual value will be non-negative; when at an upper bound the dual value will be non-positive. When maximizing the objective the required signs of the dual values are reversed. Due to their economic interpretation, the dual values associated with constraints are often referred to as shadow prices or fair prices. Mathematically, the dual values associated with variables are often referred to as reduced costs, and the dual values associated with constraints are often referred to as Lagrange multipliers.","category":"page"},{"location":"terminology.html#Sensitivity-information-for-continuous-optimization","page":"Terminology","title":"Sensitivity information for continuous optimization","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"terminology.html","page":"Terminology","title":"Terminology","text":"Analysis of the change in optimal objective value of a continuous linear optimization problem as the cost coefficients and bounds are changed is referred to in HiGHS as ranging. For an active bound, the corresponding dual value gives the change in the objective if that bound is increased or decreased. This level of analysis is often referred to as sensitivity. In general, the change in the objective is only known for a limited range of values for the active bound. HiGHS will return the limits of these bound ranges ranges, the objective value at both limits and the index of a variable or constraint that will acquire an active bound at both limits. For each variable with an active bound, the solution will remain optimal for a range of values of its cost coefficient. HiGHS will return the values of these cost ranges. For a variable or constraint whose value is not at a bound, HiGHS will return the range of values that the variable or constraint can take, the objective values at the limits of the range, and the index of a variable or constraint with a bound that will become in active at both limits.","category":"page"},{"location":"interfaces.html#Language-interfaces","page":"Interfaces","title":"Language interfaces","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"interfaces.html","page":"Interfaces","title":"Interfaces","text":"There are HiGHS interfaces for C, C#, FORTRAN, Julia and Python in HiGHS/interfaces, with example driver files in HiGHS/examples.
