Precompiled binaries are available for a variety of
platforms at the [JuliaBinaryWrappers HiGHS
repository](https://github.com/JuliaBinaryWrappers/HiGHS_jll.jl/releases). Each
includes library files for linking to external projects, and a
stand-alone executable.

* For Windows users: if in doubt, choose the `x86_64-w64-mingw32-cxx11.tar.gz` file

* For Mac users: choose the `x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz` file.
