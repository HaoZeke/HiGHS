# HiGHS - High Performance Optimization Software
[![Build Status](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/actions?query=workflow%3Abuild+branch%3Amaster)

HiGHS is a high performance serial and parallel solver for large-scale
sparse linear programming (LP), mixed-integer programming (MIP), and convex
quadratic programming (QP) models developed in C++11, with interfaces
to C, C#, FORTRAN, Julia and Python.

HiGHS is freely available under the MIT licence. 

HiGHS can be used as a standalone executable on Windows, Linux and
MacOS. There is a C++11 library which can be used within a C++ project
or, via one of the interfaces, to a project written in other
languages.

Installing HiGHS from source code requires CMake minimum version 3.15, but no other third-party utilities.
